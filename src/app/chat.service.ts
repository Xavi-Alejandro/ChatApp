  /*An observable, by definition is a data producer. Albeit a special kind that can produce data over time.
 
  A Subject on the other hand can act as both â€“ a data producer and a data consumer.
 
  This implies two things.
  1. A subject can be subscribed to, just like an observable.
  2. A subject can subscribe to other observables.
 
  That being said, there is one critical difference between a subject and an observable.
 
  All subscribers to a subject share the same execution of the subject. i.e. when a subject produces data, all of its subscribers will receive the same data. 
  This behavior is different from observables, where each subscription causes an independent execution of the observable.
